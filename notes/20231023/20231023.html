      </div>

      <p>
        <a href="../20231009/20231009.html">Last week</a>, I set up a basic connection between an ender and a midi controller. This week, I modified p5.fab to modify the g-code commands sent to the machine based on the incoming midi messages. In the video, the extrusion multiplier, speed, and deposition height are all being modified by a single midi value while printing a hollow cube.

      <p>
        A stock Ender (and other RRF machines) has a 512 byte buffer which <code>G0-3</code> commands are added to. This means that values updated before being sent are an unknown amount of time behind the actual machine. The buffer is important as the queued commands are used by the control board to plan the machine's motion. Notably, this means we can't just punctuate each move command with an <code>M400</code> else the motion stutters as the machine decelerates after each move. Maybe the 'right' way to modify g-code for a real-time response might involve modifying the printer firmware (perhaps by setting up Klipper to handle both the incoming midi messages as well as plan the printer's motion). For now, though, I'm subdividing each move command into 1mm segments (e.g. if the machine is at (0,0) and we send <code>G1 X100 Y0 Z0</code>, we instead send 100 consecutive commands to move to <code>X1</code>, <code>X2</code>, etc). I'm not sure to what extent this limits print quality, but it does result in near-real-time responsiveness. If subdivision does impact print quality, I can update this to dynamically set the subdivision length based on speed.

        Some miscellaneous reflections: 
        <ul>
          <li>Controlling the printer with the midi controller is pretty satisfying. Once I set up an quick way to map sliders & knobs to code values, I think it'll make for quick iterations.</li>
          <li>It's also convenient to just move the print head around, but the slider positions and real-world position get out of sync as you switch between 'interactive mode' to move the printer around and when it begins printing a model.</li>
          <li>Any parameter that's being controlled is going to have a max and a min value-- it'd be useful to be able to change tthge bounds of this range on-the-fly as I zero in on a window of interesting behavior.</li>
          <li>I'll plan on coming up with an interesting design that benefits from this sort of control for next week!</li>
        </ul>
